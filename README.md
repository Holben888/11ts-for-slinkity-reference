# Welcome to the 11Ts for Slinkity reference repo!

This includes a few assets we'll sprinkle into our `npm init slinkity` project during the stream. I'll call out when to reach for each one. But to be thorough:
- the `images/` directory will be copied to `public/` in our example site
- the `.eleventy.js` will _replace_ our example's `.eleventy.js`. We'll need to npm install `js-yaml` at this step as well
- the `_data/tshirts.yaml` will be copied to `src/` in our example site
- `PossumUpsell.jsx` will be copied to `src/_includes` in our example site. We'll need to npm install `@reach/tabs` at this step as well
